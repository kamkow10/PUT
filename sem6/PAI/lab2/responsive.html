            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
                literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
                Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
                source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
                of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
                during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
                section 1.10.32.</p>

            <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
                1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
                original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

            <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in
                some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
                going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
                middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
                necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin
                words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
                The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic
                words etc.</p>
